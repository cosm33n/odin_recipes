    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"I can't tell you how much I love these silky little omelettes filled with Mexican-inspired deliciousness. Making and eating them is brilliant fun, and they're unusually fulfilling for a humble omelette."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
        <li>3 limes</li>
        <li>½ a bunch of fresh coriander</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fat-free natural yoghurt </li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>½ white or green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
        <li>8 large free-range eggs</li>
        <li>60 g Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Squeeze the avocado flesh into a blender, discarding the stone and skin</li>
        <li>Squeeze in all the juice from 2 limes, rip in the coriander stalks, add the yoghurt and a splash of oil and whiz until smooth, then season to perfection.</li>
        <li>Peel the onion and carrot. Ideally in a food processor, or using a box grater and good knife skills, grate the onion and carrot, then finely slice the cabbage. Very finely slice the chilli by hand, then tip everything into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add most of the coriander leaves, then pour over the avocado dressing and toss together well. Taste and season to perfection again, if needed.</li>
        <li>Whisk all the eggs together in a bowl, with a splash of water to loosen and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat. Once fairly hot, put in a tiny drizzle of oil followed by a quarter of the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Swirl it all around the pan, grate over a quarter of the cheese and let it melt, then cook the omelette gently without colouring it, so it’s soft, silky and smooth, for just under 2 minutes, only cooking on one side.</li>
        <li>Slide it on to a plate, spoon over a quarter of the avocado slaw, then gently fold up the sides and roll over. Serve with a wedge of lime and a few extra coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining ingredients, serving them up as you go.</li>
    </ol>
